## Phonebook 

This project is a simple phonebook that saves the name, phone number, and email address of a specific contact in a database. The user is then allowed to update and delete previously stored entries.

## File Transfer Gui

This project allows the user to choose to transfer all .txt files that have been modiefied in the last 24 hours from a user-specified source directory to a destination directory of their choosing. 

## Django Checkbook App
